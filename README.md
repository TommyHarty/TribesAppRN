# TribesAppRN
Basic features of Facebook and Twitter combined

There is a lot of potential around this project to be extended into a powerful multi-group social networking platform.

To get started:

1. Create a free graph cool account

2. Add the schema found in _shcema.js

3. Add the simple api endpoint to App.js

4. Add the file api endpoint to BlockSettings.js, NewTribe.js, ProfileSettings.js, SectionSettings.js, TribeSettings.js

Then you should be good to go. You can also add your OneSignal and CodePush credentials to the project and all functions are already in place. Stripe has been integrated too, but without any of the functions.

Note: The project can definitely do with being refactored, and the components that can be refactored are very obvious, I just don't have the time to commit to the project. It was put together in about 3 days. 3 more days of work and it could look very pretty.
